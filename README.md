# copyDDSutility

**Pre-requisites**<br>
Make sure to put the bat file in the *main* BMS directory. i.e, this bat file should be placed in `..\Falcon BMS 4.35\`.

**PURPOSE**<br>
Ease of access. This will basically take the output kneeboard .DDS files from the WDP, and paste them over to the appropriate directory.
  
**Do I need this?**<br>
Completely dependant on the user preference. The end result is the same, it just speeds the process up.

**How does it work?**<br>
Some theaters like LoriKTO take their dependencies from the original KTO. This means that kneeboard textures are also taken from the main theater. However WDP does not know this, and it outputs the kneeboard images to the incorrect directory. This bat script will just move the kneeboard images to the correct directory. Feel free to analyze/edit the code to your liking.

This presents you with an option to choose which theater's files you wish to move over. 

Happy flights!
